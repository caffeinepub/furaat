# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the existing warm gold/cream/charcoal color palette with a clean white and light blue theme across the entire Furaat Trading site.

**Planned changes:**
- Update CSS custom properties in `index.css` to use clean white as the primary background and light blue as the accent color
- Update Tailwind config color tokens (brand, accent) to reflect the new white and light blue palette
- Remove gold accent classes (gold-text, arabesque-bg, etc.) and replace with light blue equivalents across all components
- Update colors in Header, Hero, ServicesSection, ServiceCard, AboutSection, ContactSection, ContactForm, and Footer to use the new palette
- Ensure all buttons, links, highlights, and decorative accents use light blue instead of gold
- Keep text dark navy or charcoal for readability against white backgrounds

**User-visible outcome:** The entire site displays a clean white and light blue color scheme consistent with the Furaat logo, replacing all gold and warm-toned accents throughout every section.
